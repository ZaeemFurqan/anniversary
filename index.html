    <h2>💌 For my jaanu</h2>
    <p>
      This is the day that really started it all, Krishna. It’s crazy that over 700 days have passed since we have known each other.<br>
      Happy 2 years, jaanu! Two whole years of tharki dreams, somehow surviving me, and I wouldn’t change a single second of it.<br>
      From the first time we talked to the first time I saw you in person, I just knew you were it. You’re still it and you forever will be my favourite feeling, my safest place, my most beautiful dream 😏.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, I could spend forever just looking at you, listening to you, existing next to you. That’s literally all I want = you.<br>
      Even after all this time, every little thing you do makes me fall harder. How are you even real? I used to believe you were a catfish at first—your profile picture seemed too gorgeous to be real.<br>
      It wasn’t until we started talking I realized what goddess I was talking to.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then your voice too—FUCK, I fell in love at first hear. I still have it saved.<br>
      I do admit it was a tad annoying how you’d edge me with 2-3 second recordings of whispering, but I’d still fall for it.<br>
      I just didn’t know it was possible to have such a lethal brain, face, and voice combo at once.

    <h2>🌸 Future</h2>
    <p>
      I’m 21 now, but you have by far given me my best 2 years of life already, and I cannot wait to increase this number as we go.<br>
      Just waking up and being next to you, cuddling or kissing, has become nothing short of a dream until I come see you again, Pookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of my friends have told me that you are LEAGUES above me, and tbh I completely agree.<br>
      I know on calls we joke around and whatnot, but are my friends not right? I mean look at you, you’re such a perfect match for anyone out there.<br>
      You have the looks, the personality, the sympathy, the care, everything that makes you a 10/10.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do agree with my friends, yet I still regard you as my life’s greatest achievement, and it’ll stay that way.<br>
      Imagine if this all actually works out one day, and we tell our kids, “Yeah, we met in a random GC.”<br>
      I cannot wait for such moments or to create new ones with you. I hope we get to see each other soon and make more memories, travel, and just build our lives together.<br>
      I love my Pookie.
